## The Brief
 
Using React, design an app that consumes a public API.


<br>
 
## The Build

After being paired our first task was to select a public API. I wanted to ensure the API we used had enough information to be interesting and could be visual. After testing a number of APIs we settled on Open Weather.

After this we created a wireframe as a guideline on how our app would look and flow.
